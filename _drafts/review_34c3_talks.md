## Gamified Control

[Link](https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-8874-gamified_control#t=2031)

I'm starting by this talk since it's a **must watch** in my opinion.

China has implemented their new Social Credit System (`SCS`) throught the use of big data and surveillance.
This system will rate the online and offline behavior of the citizen to assess them and give them a score.
Depending how well you _perform_, you will get bonuses or penalities. More important, the score is determined by
you friend's score.

China has **gamified** being an obedient citizen, using **social pressure**.

Notes:
- SCS will be mandatory for every citizen in 2020
- the BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) are collaborating with the governement
- what pushes your score up
    * retweeting the governement propaganda (economy, etc)
    * buying local products
    * having obedient friends
- whats pushes your score down
    * posting stuff about the tiananmen massacre...
    * buying foreign product (anime from japan, etc..)
- bonuses:
    * faster administration paperwork and procedures (travel papers)
- penalties:
    * lower internet
    * filtered access to the jobmarket
- **anybody can check your score**
- and which friends are dragging your score down
- it's the most powerful oppression tool, since it doesn't rely on violence or
  fear, but on social pressure, which is maintained by the individual
  themselves
- in preparation since 2005, the Chinese gov understood from the beginning the potential of social media and big data
- borader spectrum than China: a tendency to answer social problems with tehcnological solutions

## Spy vs. Spy: A Modern Study Of Microphone Bugs Operation And Detection

[Link](https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-8735-spy_vs_spy_a_modern_study_of_microphone_bugs_operation_and_detection)

What's the status of security research to detect hidden spy microphones ?

The researchers present a state-of-the-art study of microphone bugs, as well as
a tool called `Salamandra` to detect and locate hidden microphones !

Notes:
- _The Thing_: a microphone bug, *batteryless*, was installed in a US ambassy
- You can plant a bug in an appartment and listen to the audio just fine from
  300m.

## How to drift with any car

[link](https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-8758-how_to_drift_with_any_car)

They describe how the various electronic components that control your car are
communicating with each over, and how you can listen to the BUS and send your
own messages.

The funny part was when they plugged this with a XBox controller, and played a
video game using the car's wheel as a controler input... :)

Notes:
- various parts of your cars are controller by ECU
- ABS, Transmission, Engine, etc...
- ECU: `Electronic Control Unit`
- more than 70 in a modern car
- they talk to each other through a CAN bus
- you can talk to the CAN bus with a special diagnostic mode known as `OBD-II`
